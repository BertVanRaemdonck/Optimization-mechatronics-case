The translational speed vector is Rt*[i1;0], so Rt defines a rotation matrix that rotates the x-axis to an axis parallel to the speed vector, so

	Rt = [cos(theta)	-sin(theta)]
		 [sin(theta)	cos(theta) ]
		 
If we take the derivative with respect to time and say that omega = dtheta/dt, we get

	dRt/dt = [-sin(theta)*omega		-cos(theta)*omega]
			 [cos(theta)*omega		-sin(theta)*omega]
			 
Notice that if we factor out omega, the first column of that matrix is equal to the second column of Rt and the second column of dRt/dt is equal to the negative of the first column of Rt, so we can write dRt/dt as

	dRt/dt = [cos(theta)	-sin(theta)]	*	 [0		-1]		*	 omega
			 [sin(theta)	cos(theta) ]		 [1		0 ]
			 
or

	dRt/dt = Rt * [0		-omega]
				  [omega	0	  ]
				  
and omega = dtheta/dt can be said to be the "curvature speed" according to its definition, so you can write omega = i2, which gives the desired equation.
